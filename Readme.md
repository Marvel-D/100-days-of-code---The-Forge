## Welcome to the 100 days of product development.

![cover](/images/cover.jpeg)
A development initiative by members of the Forge - Marvellous Amos, Golden Monday and Alozie Miracle.

As the name implies, this initiative is centered around upskilling the participant technologically, improving business-product translation ability and developing a character founded on consistency and dedication.

`5 minutes`, `1 hour`, `a full day!`... the time spent daily is entirely up to you to decide as long as you code.

To participate in this challenge,

- Visit the repo [here](https://github.com/Marvel-D/100-days-of-code---The-Forge)
- Fork then Clone the repository
- Create a new breach named as YOUR_NAME (e.g. `-b  <Kulture> `)
- And get coding.

> Don't forget to push your local git branch to the github repository along with your daily build and create a pull request to have your amazing work added to the to the build.

Looking a bit complex? Not sue how to start... well you have a 100 days to figure it out.

It's gonna be a challenge, but I guess you wouldn't be here if wasn't.
